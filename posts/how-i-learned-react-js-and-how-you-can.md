As most of the people, I also started my development career with Angular (1.x) but after sometimes React started to make
noise in the industry. At that time, I was working on Angular(1.x), and itâ€™s very been so hard to introduce and
try new library/framework to the system and Angular(1.x) was fulfilling the need.

But on a personal note, Everyone wants to learn new bleeding technology to grow in the industry, and I was also surrounded
by this type of questions.

*In my case, the answer was [Verdaccio](https://github.com/verdaccio/verdaccio).*

![](/verdaccio-banner@2x.png)
[Verdaccio](https://github.com/verdaccio/verdaccio) is a simple, zero-config-required local private npm registry.

## How do Verdaccio and React have a connection ? 

In my company, we decided to use [Verdaccio](https://www.verdaccio.org/) as our private npm registry and setup went very 
smooth. I faced a little problem to host it using nginx and 
a [small contribution](https://github.com/verdaccio/docker-examples/pull/5/files) to the documentation solved the issue.

## hmm. that is cool but still not able to figure out a connection ?

So after first my contribution, I just came to know about [Verdaccio](https://www.verdaccio.org/) community. The community was 
also looking for the contribution to develop new features and fix bugs. I just quickly realised the learning opportunity
and made up my mind to contribute to it. Also, [Verdaccio](https://www.verdaccio.org/) uses React for User Interface.

## That is great..., but I can learn by developing some apps and opting some course.

Definitely, You can learn any technology by making hello world applications, and it is very helpful to know quickly 
about the things, but I think it is hard to get the full knowledge and all aspects. So if you want to brush up our 
skill on that particular language and open source contribution is the way as:
- You put your thought and code in front of many skilled developers who are going to review your PR and give 
constructive feedback.
- You will learn to follow community guidelines and teamwork.
- Learning to work remotely from different places is also a cool thing.
- It could be a good chance for other people to learn many things from your PR. After all, it is a cooperative learning 
to build better solutions for the community.
- You will meet many great developers and learn a lot of things (not just coding and technology) while contributing, and
 it will help you to get your dream job.

## From small code changes to write unit testing 

I started with small code changes and sooner I got familiar with most of the codebase. I started to fix few bugs. At that
time [Verdaccio](https://www.verdaccio.org/) was a small React application, but it lacked the testing of React 
components. I really liked the opportunity and started to write test in Jest and Enzyme.

In the end I learned React with testing, and its use-cases.

## Maintainers are really helpful, and youâ€™ll learn a lot

I personally enjoy contributing to [Verdaccio](https://www.verdaccio.org/) and [Juan Picado](https://twitter.com/jotadeveloper) 
and Meoww helped me to get started. They helped me at many places and solved my silly mistakes. Though most of the PR have 
something to add, and their review was very important for learning. (Do not be afraid of silly mistakes, These are fine 
and no one really mind them. Itâ€™s fun.)

## We were also trending on Github

## Finally, Joined the Verdaccio team as a maintainer

A year back I read an article â€” [Programming achievements: How to level up as a developer by Jason Rudolph ](http://jasonrudolph.com/blog/2011/08/09/programming-achievements-how-to-level-up-as-a-developer/) 
and it states that:

- Contribute to an open source project.
- Have a patch accepted.
- Earn the commit rights on a significant open source project.
- Publish an open source project.
- Perform a [Refactotum](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2007/04/03/twir.html) of an open source project.

Currently, I and [Juan Picado](https://twitter.com/jotadeveloper?lang=en) are 
maintaining [Vedaccio-htpasswd](https://github.com/verdaccio/verdaccio-htpasswd) plugin. I refactored it to use in 
current [Verdaccio](https://www.verdaccio.org/)  eco-system.

## It helped me a lot to get my new job in Berlin

I mentioned all above things in my resume and every interviewer asked about contribution and my role 
in [Verdaccio](https://www.verdaccio.org/). The interviewers got very impressed with it. Also, It showed my capability,
learning curve, teamwork, motivation and passion for programming.
